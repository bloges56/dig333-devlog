## Week 1

### Context
  
- The TEDx presentation by Tom Igoe discusses how physical computing is the concept of computers tracking physical inputs from people.  He gives multiple examples such as a flight simulator where someone actually flaps his arms like wings and one where a tub of mud is used for input.  He also discusses the pros and cons of the open source physical computing community.
- "I wanna see a place where there is flow between these two different models." - Tom Igoe
    - Tom is referring to the model of big manufacturing and the model of open source schematic sharing.
- It is defeinitely encouraging to see communities being open to newcomers and everyone helping each other develop thei skills and products.
- Where should the line be drawn for what kind of schematics should be open source?
